Jspych experiment code for selecting multiple options project

Experiment code for: A Process Account of Multi-Response Economic Decision Making

## What does the multi-response code do?

Subjects will be asked to make choices between 4, 8, or 12 alternatives, selecting one, two, or three options (see Fig. For each choice selection size condition, there will be a total of XXX trials (XX per set size), each comprising random items selected from the stimulus set. Trials will be blocked by choice selection size and the number of alternatives, and the block order will be randomized across subjects. At the start of each trial, subjects will be presented 4, 8, or 12 alternatives and asked to choose either one, two, or three of the food items they would most like to eat. Choice will be indicated using keypresses. Upon selection, an orange box will be drawn around the chosen item (with the other items still on the screen) and will persist until the subject chooses the number of items equal to the selection size for that block.


### TODO:
make the code work for many alternatives...it needs to factor through each condition (number of alternatives). (4, 8, 12).

Will the eye tracking still work? 

create new instructions block with key mappings  (should we have a practice session?s)
