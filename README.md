# select_multi_options
Jspych experiment for selecting multiple options project

Things to do:
Find example code for simple reaction time experiment
How do we put a montage of images onto the screen (15 or so)
How do we get mouse inputs to track of specific areas on the screen
recoding click times
    -wrt the start of the trial (its only one trial)
    -wrt the last click
    -I guess technically we only need the time when each click and final button press was recorded wrt stim onset
code up reaction time experiment with a single selection option (space bar)

(note you still need to make the new stimuli set) Ask Taro for it

Intro slides
