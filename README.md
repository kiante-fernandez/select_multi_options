# select_multi_options
Jspych experiment for selecting multiple options project

Things to do:
- how do we mark which the type of item each option selected is? We need a data id that tells us which jpg was selected
- do we add the mouse tracking still since we know when an option is selected?
- eye tracking calibration phase (see web gazer extension)
- how do we prevent subjects from deselecting options
- where are we sending the data after collection
- where are we deploying the web application?
